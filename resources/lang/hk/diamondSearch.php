	//cut
	'cutEx' => '一粒切割優良的鑽石，切工的比例令鑽石在亮度和火彩上可以創造出完美的光學反射，所以切割優良的鑽石在價格上相對高點。',

	'cutDesrciption' => '鑽石切割不僅指切割鑽石的尺寸，而且更重要的是通過切割過程把鑽石對光線折射完美呈現在觀賞者眼中。 一粒鑽石更可以經由優良的切割令它看起來更閃亮和光彩，更令它看起來比相同的卡數重量大。切割如果不良，則鑽石會變得暗淡無光彩和沒美感。如鑽石切得太薄，雖然表面大了，但是底部會出現漏光的情況，如切得太厚，鑽石的側邊都會出現漏光的情況。',

	'caratDescription' => 'The international unit of weight used for measuring diamonds and gemstones, 1 carat is equal to 200 milligrams, or 0.2 grams. A specific measurement of a diamond\'s weight, carat weight alone may not accurately represent a diamond\'s visual size.',
	'caratDescription1' => 'We recommend considering carat weight along with two other influential characteristics: the overall dimensions and the cut grade of the diamond.',

	//color
	'colorDtoF' => 'Inlaid in platinum or platinum in the most popular "colorless" grading. Even the smallest amount of color is hard to detect even by trained people.',
	'colorGtoJ' => 'Diamond in the near colorless range, viewed from the front appears colorless. But put it in a white background, and then when viewed from the bottom, you will see a slight color. Usually in the ring mosaic naked eye it is difficult to perceive their color. Table near colorless diamonds, and their prices are very favorable.',

	//clarity
	
	'clarityI' => 'I1: The contents are visible to the naked eye.',
	'claritySi' => 'SI1-SI2: Weakness. The contents are visible at 10x magnification. If the naked eye has the best value. Sensitive to the naked eye may be aware of SI2 inclusions.',

	'clarityVvs' => 'VVS1-VVS2: Very slight flaw. The features are subtle and even trained ones are hard to see under 10x magnification.',
	'clarityIf' => 'Immaculate: No internal or external features. Internal flawless: There may be only external flaws. Both are extremely rare.',
	'clarityDescription' => 'Want to learn even more about clarity',
	'clarityDescription1' => 'Clarity refers to a diamond\'s relative absence of tiny, natural characteristics known as blemishes and inclusions.',
	'clarityDescription2' => 'Many of these characteristics are microscopic and do not affect a diamond\'s beauty in any discernible way.',
